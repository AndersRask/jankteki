this is the beginnings of what I hope will be a useful jinteki.net extension.

Currently it maintains a list of friends online and pins links to their running games to the top of the screen.

It also contains functionality to demarcate "bad" players.

All of the users currently in thoses lists are entirely arbitrary and just happened to be online when I was testing.

Next steps - interface to add and remove users from the respective lists.

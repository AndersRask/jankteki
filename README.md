I hope one day this will be a useful jinteki.net extension.

Currently it maintains a list of friends (or cyber-celebrities ;-) ) online and pins links to their running games to the top of the screen.

Once I've got a couple of dummy icons, and made it look less crap, I shall be releasing this in the Chrome App Store.
